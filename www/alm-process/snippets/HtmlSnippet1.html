  <h2 class="doubleparagraph">Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>(Nearly) Native User Experience</strong>
    <br>Quaqua user interface delegates closely look and behave
      like their native counterparts. Complex user interface components, such
      as JFileChooser and JColorChooser, are close enough to make end users feel
      comfortable with them.<br> </li>
    <li class="semiparagraph"><strong>Blend into OS X Designs</strong><br>
    Quaqua supports three OS X designs: Tiger, Panther, Jaguar.
      Quaqua automatically chooses the right design for the current operating
      system.<br> </li>
    <li class="semiparagraph"><strong>Alternative Styles</strong><br>
      Quaqua offers alternative styles for many user interface
      elements. Such as small styles for most of the components, as well as a
      striped style for tables, lists and trees. Jaguar-design like tabbed panes
      with stacking tabs are also supported.<br> </li>
    <li class="semiparagraph"><strong>Additional Components</strong><br>
  Quaqua provides Swing implementations of NSBrowser and NSSheet
      (named JBrowser and JSheet).<br> </li>
    <li class="semiparagraph"><strong>Clean Layout</strong><br>
     Laying out Aqua components with Java is quite challenging.
      Quaqua provides an API for component alignment based on visual criteria
      (baseline, visual bounds, preferred gaps). JScrollPane's automatically
      avoid overlaps with the grow-boxes of windows.<br> </li>
    <li><strong>Localized in four languages</strong><br>
    Quaqua is localized in the following languages: German, French, Italian and
      English.<br> </li>
</ul>
